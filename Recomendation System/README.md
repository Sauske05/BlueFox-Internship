# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** notebook implements a simple yet effective recommendation engine based on collaborative filtering. It processes a dataset of user ratings and leverages item-based similarity (cosine similarity) to suggest similar movies.

This project demonstrates:
- Basic **data loading and preprocessing** with Pandas,
- Construction of a **user-item matrix**,
- **Cosine similarity computation** between movie vectors,
- Interactive function to retrieve **top N similar movie recommendations**.

## Features

- ðŸ“¥ **CSV Data Load** â€“ Reads user-item ratings from `rating.csv`
- ðŸ§® **User-Item Matrix Creation** â€“ Constructs pivot table for recommendation basis
- ðŸ“Š **Cosine Similarity Calculation** â€“ Measures similarity between movies
- ðŸ§  **Top-N Movie Recommendations** â€“ Recommends similar movies based on a target title
- ðŸ“ˆ **Simple yet Scalable Logic** â€“ Can be adapted to larger collaborative filtering systems
