A simple recommendation based system that is based on Netflix TV shows and Movies. 
The recommendation system uses cosine-similarity to recommend the top 5 most similar movies based on the input movie.
Two columns i.e. 'type' and 'listed_in' were combined together and used to calculate the cosine similarity of each movies with one another.
